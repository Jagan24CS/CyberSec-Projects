# CyberSec-Projects

1. **Port Scanner:**
   - **Description:** Scans a range of IP addresses and ports to identify open ports on a target system. Useful for network security assessments. In my project, the number of open and closed ports will be mentioned, and invalid IP addresses will be identified.

2. **Keylogger:**
   - **Description:** Captures and logs keystrokes on a target system. Intended for educational purposes to understand keystroke logging mechanisms. In my project, keys like "TAB", "SPACE", "CTRL", "BACKSPACE," etc., are well defined.

3. **Backdoor:**
   - **Description:** Establishes a covert connection to a target system, allowing remote access and control. Designed for educational use in understanding the implications of backdoor vulnerabilities. In my project, you can upload, download, and execute certain commands on the target system.
